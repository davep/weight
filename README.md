# weight
A very simple tool for converting weight.

It seriously bugs me that the Weight Watchers website only seems to work in
stones and pounds when recording weight, and yet is happy to use metric for
food weights, etc. On top of that I've been recording my weight in Google
Fit for some time now and I'm using kilos there.

So, every time I want to put my weight into the WW website, I have to use
some crappy conversion site that is filled with adverts and the like.

On top of this, I can't persuade Google to do the conversion for me because
the WW site wants stones and decimal pounds, not decimal stones, etc.

Finally, a short while ago, I cracked and knocked together a very quick and
dirty conversion tool. Designed for me to easily find on my phone, and 100%
hosted on GitHub (because... reasons).

http://blog.davep.org/weight/ is now a thing. Likely a thing I'll use lots
and never tweak again. But at least the itch has been scratched and I don't
have to use rubbish advert-filled sites.
